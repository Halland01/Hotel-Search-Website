# Hotel-Search-Website
a.	Design framework Apache (virtual host), PHP (server-script language), Windows (Operating system).
b.	For client-side design part, I choose to use responsive web design that makes web page look good on all devices such as tables, phones, and desktops. At result, I use bootstrap to complete this part.
c.	For the front-end UI part, I have used HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, and bootstrap technologies to design each page layout.
d.	For client-side to enhance user interactivity, I have used JQuery and Ajax to update a web page, check business rules and validate form without reloading this page.
e.	For Server-side design part, I have chosen PHP language to achieve the data transform between client-side and server-side.
f.	MySQL that is relational database is used to store and retrieve relevant information include hotel information and userâ€™s information.
g.	For server-side connect to database, I have chosen PDO that is server side scripting technology is used to allowing users to Login main page, add new user, search hotel info, modify and delete user by admin user account, etc.
h.	Implementation of security feature, I have chosen MD5 to encrypt user password. 
i.	This website can use IIS to publish with route as personal server for test.
